title: Introducing Schrift, a Jekyll template designed for prose.
---
*I have often tried to design a weblog style that would focus on the content and would still be elegant and nice to look at. I don't pretend I have achieved it yet. But here is my most recent attempt at it. I'm making this template **for Jekyll** **available now**. Please and hack!*

* Download it from the [git repository](https://github.com/Schoewilliam/Schrift),
* Have a look at the [demo site](http://schoewilliam.github.io/Schrift/).
