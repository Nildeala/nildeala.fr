<small>A great post by my friend **Nino Vranešič** about the urgent situation on copyright legislation in Europe. It's available [on his blog](http://blog.elnino.si/post/150440175422/the-web-is-in-danger-copyright-reform-can-break) in English, and [on mine](/2016/09/15/eu-copyright-reform.html) in French.</small>
