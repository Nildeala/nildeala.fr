### **Minisch**
My first attempt at creating an original and sober theme. It was designed for Wordpress. It works out-of-the-box and can be easily customised through a simple configuration UI.

### **Schrift**
A weblog style (for Jekyll) that focuses on the content while being elegant and nice to look at. Please use and hack!
