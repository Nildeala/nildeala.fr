![My proud look. Or something like that.](/images/layout/logos/pride-look-v2-300px.png){: class="align right avatar"} Geography student. Always in favor of an [open web](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/), and sometimes web designer. I like trains and Human beings. But mostly trains.

I've actively written [a blog](/en/archive) for a few years. Don't be surprised if I keep updating it every so often though. [(...)](/en/about)
