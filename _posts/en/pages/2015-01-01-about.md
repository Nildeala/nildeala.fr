Hi! I'm William, aka Schoewilliam, and I'm a young, French & [RÃ©unionese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9union) web designer. I have always been enthusiast about the idea of an open web in an open connected world. That is why I recognize myself through the values of the [Mozilla Manifesto](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/).

I always seek to design simple, clean and lightweight interfaces, while keeping in mind my aim for creativity and elegance.  
But the main principle I try to respect in my projects is to contribute to the growth and the adoption of web technology standards.  
Finally, I pay particular attention to typography and its role in a modern interface.
