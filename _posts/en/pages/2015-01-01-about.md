*I am William Dorffer* [aka *Schoewilliam*], and I am an open web enthusiast. I essentially spend my free time experimenting with free software, my various writings, or contributing to Mozilla's misson.  
Also, I happen to dream about Iceland.  
Most of my posts are written in French, but I do happen to write in English too.
