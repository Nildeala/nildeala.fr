Geography student. Always in favor of an [open web](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/), and sometimes web designer. Weirdly interested in urbanism, metro networks, and trains.

I've actively written [a blog](/en/archive) for a few years. Don't be surprised if I keep updating it every so often though.

When I try my hand at web design, I always seek to design simple, clean and lightweight interfaces, while keeping in mind my aim for creativity and elegance.  
One of the principles I try to respect in my projects is to contribute to the growth and the adoption of web technology standards.  
My various projects and experimentations are almost all on [Github](https://github.com/Nildeala).

I also happen to [contribute](https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/Nildeala/) to some of Mozilla's projects. You will maybe stumble upon me on local events in the Lyon area.
