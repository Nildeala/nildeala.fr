Geography student. In favor of an [open web](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/), and sometimes web designer. I'm a trans woman who likes trains and Human beings. But mostly trains.

My thoughts and various texts are published on [my blog](/en/archive). I'm fairly active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Nildeala), although I do reserve the right to be uninteresting, innocent, and grumpy.

I grew up in La RÃ©union, an obviously wonderful island, about which you obviously know everything, because there isn't any comparably unique place that you know of.  
I've been living in Lyon, France, since 2014 when I started to study at university.

From 2012 to 2015 I actively [contributed](https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/Nildeala/) to the late projects of the Mozilla foundation as App Reviewer on the (now dead) Firefox Marketplace for Firefox OS.
My other various projects and experimentations related to the Web are almost all on [Github](https://github.com/Nildeala).

I'm not an activist, but I do personally believe we need a society of social progress, especially concerning the rights of LGBTQ+ people.
