This spring I was offered by Vice.com journalist Bruno Lus to tell of my experience as a trans woman regarding health professionals.

[I warmly recommend you read the resulting article](https://www.vice.com/fr/article/xwmgea/transphobie-a-lhopital-un-medecin-a-refuse-de-me-toucher) (French), based on the testimonies of several trans people and their experiences when confronting medical transphobia. The latter is very real today in France.
